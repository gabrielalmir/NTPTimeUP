# NTP Time Updater üï∞Ô∏è

This is a simple application to update the system time based on the time obtained from an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server.

## How to use ü§î

To use this application, simply download the `NTPTimeUP.zip` file and extract it somewhere on your system. Then, just run the `NTPTimeUP.exe` file to start the application.

Once the application is started, simply click the "Sync with NTP" button to update the system time based on the time obtained from an NTP server.

If everything goes well, you will see a success message indicating that the time was synchronized successfully. Otherwise, you will see an error message indicating the problem that occurred.
