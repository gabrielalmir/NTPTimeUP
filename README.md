# NTP Time Updater 🕰️

This is a simple CLI application to update the Windows's time based on the time obtained from an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server.

## How to use 🤔

To use this application, simply download the `NTPTimeUP.zip` file and extract it somewhere on your system. Then, just run the `NTPTimeUP.exe` file as administrator to start the application.

If everything goes well, you will see a success message indicating that the time was synchronized successfully. Otherwise, you will see an error message indicating the problem that occurred.
